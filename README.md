# Covid-19 Death and Recovered Rate Analysis

In December 2019 the first case of COVID-19 was found in Wuhan,China. From that moment it spread widely in China infecting a huge number of people. On March 11 World Health
Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a ”global pandemic”. Presently this virus is spreading like a wildfire, infecting millions of people all around the globe. Currently the
most infected place is Europe and USA having more than 20000 infections per day. I focused on the rise of COVID-19 and predicting the future effect of this virus
in Germany. The first case in Germany was recorded in January 27,2020 near Munich. Huge number of infection started to arise after the carnival which happened on February 24, 2020.
On March 9,2020 the first death case was recorded in Germany from Essen and Heinsberg. On mid of March the first lockdown was imposed on Germany. The infection rate started to
fall with the help of strict lockdown measures. The second lockdown started on November 2,2020 as the number of infection has reached its peak. As of now the lockdown is still
continuing with even strict measurements. The rate is still uncontrollable and death toll is around 1000 a day. For our lab work we computed some models and using those models we predicted the future outcome of COVID-19 in Germany for the upcoming future.
